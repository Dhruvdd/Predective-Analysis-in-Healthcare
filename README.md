# Predective-Analysis-in-Healthcare

Here, I have worked on some diseases like Heart, Liver and Diabetes. Where I have trained and used the models to predict the disease, by which it help in 
healthcare and can help to detect early signs of patient deterioration, identify at-risk patients in their homes, and predict and can give accurate decision respectively.

I have used the KNeighbour Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier , where this models are trained and had been evaluated where it can be find which model is most accurate.
